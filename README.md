# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List application I developed using React. The app allows users to add, toggle, and delete their tasks. It uses local storage to save todos, ensuring that your tasks are preserved even after refreshing the page. 

## Features

- **Add Todo:** Users can input a new todo item and add it to the list.
- **Toggle Completion:** Users can mark todos as completed or not.
- **Delete Todo:** Users can delete todos from the list.
- **Persistence:** Todos are saved in local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

## Future Improvements

I have some ideas for enhancing the app in the future:

- **Edit Todo:** Allow users to edit existing todos.
- **Due Dates:** Add the ability to set due dates for each task.
- **Categories:** Implement a categorization feature for organizing tasks.
- **Filter and Sort:** Add options to filter and sort todos based on their status or due date.
